# ============================================
# ADMIN ACCOUNT FALLBACK CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: These credentials are ONLY used as a fallback when:
# 1. No admin account exists in the database
# 2. You cannot access the application normally
#
# After getting access, CREATE AN ADMIN ACCOUNT IN THE DATABASE
# and remove these environment variables for security.

# Option 1: Use plaintext password (simple, less secure - only for development!)
# ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
# ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Option 2: Use pre-hashed bcrypt password (recommended for production)
# Generate with: npx bcrypt-cli hash "your_password"
# ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
# ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$10$...generated_bcrypt_hash...

# ============================================
# NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS
# ============================================
# These variables should NEVER be committed to git!
# They are ONLY for emergency access if the database admin account is lost.
# 
# To set up proper admin access:
# 1. Use the fallback admin to log in
# 2. Go to Admin Panel → User Management
# 3. Create a permanent admin account in the database
# 4. Remove/comment out ADMIN_PASSWORD and ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
# 5. Commit only to your local .env file (not to git)
